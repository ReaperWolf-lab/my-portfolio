            Hi, my name is JP Gouws. I am a 32year old male that recently
            started falling in love with coding!I have decided to become a self
            taught Web Developer! I am a qualified Basic Life Support Medic and
            worked on ambulances for the last 13 years. I have decided to change
            my career due some personal reasons. I always wonderred what I would
            like to do other than work on an ambulance.
          </p>
          <p>After doing a lot of soul searching I have found my answer.....</p>
          <div class="coding-text">CODING!!!</div>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            My whole life I spent a lot of time infront of my computer, so
            naturaly I wanted to do something in line with computers when
            changing career!
          </p>
          <p>
            After doing some research,looking at what opportunities is out in
            the world when it comes to coding,I have found a path that I would
            like to follow.Take a look for yourself to see how you want to
            progress:
            <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank"> learning roadmap</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            With some research and looking at different types of careers to
            follow in coding I have decided that I want to start with Front End
            Development!
          </p>
          <p>You may ask, Why Front End Development?</p>
          <p>
            Well, for me its not the simplicity of front end but more about what
            you can show through what you know. Designing and implementing
            diffent things together to bring a user a pleasing ,eye catching
            webpage. through front end it lures the consumer, make them interact
            with your design and makes them feel important!
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you are on social media, doing online shopping, using your
            mobile device or computer, most of the things you do, Start with
            Front End Development!
          </p>
          <p>
            While you are here on the About Page,You have already seen multiple
            design inputs, functions and interactions! All this has been done
            through CODING! Even though it is one page, hours goes into
            designing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am excited to be starting this journey and changing my career. My
            journey will not end with Front End Development!
